1 The sickness of this world is destroying all the dreams
3 The race for complication communicate reaction

7 My soul unraveled out of mental
9
11 Accelerate the vision high beyond the curse of time
13 This force increases and tells me where to go
15 Follow, I enter my dimension, awakened heart for life
17 I find the will to live straight
19 I feel the change, I see the vicious circle
21 Having the whole world in my hands, filled
23
25 Imaginative interaction
27 Forever there
29 Is it the fear to fall in space that keeps us from understanding
31 Increase your fall on purpose and let this river flow
33
35 You made it to this point no one can tell you how
37 That was tearing your soul apart, you finally find yourself
