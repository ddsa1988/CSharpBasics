1 The sickness of this world is destroying all the dreams
2 The fools are kings, tearing apart the soul
3 The race for complication communicate reaction
4 The lack of heart of men, I grow distant from the core
5
6 Borrow this body for a lifetime, earthly material
7 My soul unraveled out of mental
8 The shell returns to dust
9
10 I focus on the present concentrate on what I find
11 Accelerate the vision high beyond the curse of time
12 Bring light to my attention, the walls of vacuum fall
13 This force increases and tells me where to go
14
15 Follow, I enter my dimension, awakened heart for life
16 Enforce my senses, I'm understanding,
17 I find the will to live straight
18
19 I feel the change, I see the vicious circle
20 Finally turned into a virtuous one
21 Having the whole world in my hands, filled
22 Timelessness
23
24 Out of the frame, I feel so vast I'm all around myself
25 Imaginative interaction
26 But I keep struggling inside to hold this always
27 Forever there
28
29 Is it the fear to fall in space that keeps us from understanding
30 The only way to find the power is to look inside
31 Increase your fall on purpose and let this river flow
32 Now you hold this secret appeared out of the vacuum of space
33
34 Remain in what you are, the center of your life
35 You made it to this point no one can tell you how
36 You crawled and bled all the way, but you were the only one
37 That was tearing your soul apart, you finally find yourself
